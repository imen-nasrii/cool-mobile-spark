ChatGPT a dit :
It looks like your WebSocket connection is failing because your code is sometimes trying to connect to an invalid URL like:

ruby
Copier
Modifier
wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...
That undefined suggests the port or host value in your WebSocket URL is missing.

Here’s the breakdown of what’s going wrong:

First attempt:

ruby
Copier
Modifier
wss://6cea9b86-4694-4d0f-948e-08c5d2e1f7e6-00-u17kma55oacy.riker.replit.dev/?token=XrxmyRm1XTtL
This looks like a Replit-provided WebSocket endpoint. That’s fine, but the connection failed (could be server down, wrong token, or network restrictions).

Fallback attempt:

ruby
Copier
Modifier
wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...
This is clearly invalid because undefined is not a valid port number. That means somewhere in your setupWebSocket or fallback function, you’re pulling process.env.PORT or a config value, but it’s not defined.

Likely cause:
Your code probably has something like:

js
Copier
Modifier
const port = process.env.PORT;
const url = `wss://${host}:${port}/?token=${token}`;
and when port is not set, it becomes undefined.

How to fix:

Make sure you define the port (e.g., PORT=443 for secure WebSockets) when falling back to localhost.

Or use a conditional so that if there’s no port, you don’t add :undefined:

js
Copier
Modifier
const portPart = port ? `:${port}` : '';
const wsUrl = `wss://${host}${portPart}/?token=${token}`;
Ensure host and port come from a proper config for both production (Replit domain) and development (localhost).

If you want, I can walk through how to make a WebSocket URL builder that works both locally and on Replit so you won’t see undefined again. That way your setupWebSocket won’t break when switching environments.
