Got it üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this error down clearly.

The Error
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". 
Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.


This means:

The browser is trying to load a JavaScript module (via <script type="module" src="..."> or import ... from ...).

But instead of receiving a .js file with Content-Type: application/javascript, the server responded with HTML (text/html).

This usually happens because the server couldn‚Äôt find the file you requested and fell back to serving your index.html.

Why It Happens

Common causes:

Wrong file path / missing build output

Example: You try to load /main.tsx, but the bundler should have transpiled it to /dist/main.js.

Since /main.tsx doesn‚Äôt exist in the served folder, the dev server returns index.html.

Incorrect server configuration (MIME types)

The server must send JS files with Content-Type: application/javascript.

If it sends text/html or text/plain, browsers reject it.

React / Vite / Webpack setup issue

If you‚Äôre using Vite or CRA, the dev server should handle .tsx files automatically.

If you directly reference main.tsx in your HTML, the browser won‚Äôt understand it ‚Äî it needs the bundled .js.

How to Fix

‚úÖ If you‚Äôre using Vite/CRA/Next.js/etc.

Don‚Äôt include .tsx files directly in <script> tags.

Instead, reference the output entry (usually main.js or handled automatically by index.html from Vite/CRA).

‚úÖ Check your index.html

<!-- ‚ùå Wrong -->
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>

<!-- ‚úÖ Correct (Vite will resolve) -->
<script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>


‚úÖ If you built the project

Make sure you serve the dist/ or build/ folder, not src/.

‚úÖ Check server MIME types

If using Express, make sure static files are served properly:

app.use(express.static("dist")); // not src


‚ö° In short:
Your browser expected JavaScript, but your server gave back HTML (probably index.html). This usually means the script path is wrong or you‚Äôre directly pointing to .tsx instead of the compiled .js.

Do you want me to look at your index.html (or entry file) and show the exact line that needs fixing?
