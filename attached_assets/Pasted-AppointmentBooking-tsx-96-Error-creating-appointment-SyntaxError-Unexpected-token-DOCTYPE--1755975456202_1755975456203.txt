AppointmentBooking.tsx:96 Error creating appointment: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
handleSubmit	@	AppointmentBooking.tsx:96
ChatGPT a ditÂ :

That error usually happens when your frontend expects JSON, but the server is actually returning HTML (often an error page, like a 404 Not Found or a frameworkâ€™s default error response).

Letâ€™s break it down:

Why it happens

Unexpected token '<' â†’ JSON canâ€™t start with <, but HTML does (<!DOCTYPE html> or <html>).

Your fetch/axios call is trying to parse the response as JSON (response.json()), but the server didnâ€™t return JSON.

Common causes

Wrong API URL â†’ Maybe the request is going to the frontend server instead of the backend, returning your index.html.

Backend error â†’ The API hit an error and returned an HTML error page.

Missing headers â†’ Some APIs require Content-Type: application/json in the request.

Proxy misconfiguration â†’ If youâ€™re using something like CRAâ€™s proxy or Next.js API routes, the request might not be routed correctly.

How to debug

Check the Network tab (DevTools â†’ Network)

Find your request.

See what URL was hit and what the response body looks like.

If itâ€™s HTML â†’ the issue is on the backend or the URL.

Log the raw response before parsing

const response = await fetch("/api/appointments", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(appointmentData),
});

const text = await response.text();
console.log("Raw response:", text);

try {
  const data = JSON.parse(text);
  console.log("Parsed JSON:", data);
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Not valid JSON:", e);
}


That will confirm if the backend is actually sending JSON.

Fix the root issue

If itâ€™s returning HTML â†’ check your API route, URL, and backend logs.

If itâ€™s returning an error page â†’ fix the backend error.

Ensure the API always responds with valid JSON (even for errors).

ðŸ‘‰ Can you share the fetch/axios code youâ€™re using on line 96 of AppointmentBooking.tsx and maybe the request URL? Thatâ€™ll help me pinpoint whether itâ€™s a URL mismatch or a backend response issue.
