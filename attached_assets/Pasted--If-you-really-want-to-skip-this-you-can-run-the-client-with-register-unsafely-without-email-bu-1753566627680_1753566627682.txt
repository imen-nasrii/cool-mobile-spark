--register-unsafely-without-email but you will then be unable to receive notice
about impending expiration or revocation of your certificates or problems with
your Certbot installation that will lead to failure to renew.

Requesting a certificate for tomati.org and www.tomati.org


Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: nginx). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: tomati.org
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 213.186.33.5: Invalid response from http://www.tomati.org: "<html xml:lang=\"fr-FR\" lang=\"fr-FR\">\n<head>\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n<title qtlid=\"74178\">Site en con"

  Domain: www.tomati.org
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 213.186.33.5: Invalid response from http://www.tomati.org: "<html xml:lang=\"fr-FR\" lang=\"fr-FR\">\n<head>\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">\n<title qtlid=\"74178\">Site en con"

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary nginx configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure the listed domains point to this nginx server and that it is accessible from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
