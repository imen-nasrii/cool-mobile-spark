You're getting two key types of errors here â€” a WebSocket construction error and a 401 Unauthorized on a POST request â€” along with lots of normal-looking token-based API calls. Here's what each issue means and how to fix it:

ðŸ”´ 1. WebSocket URL Error
pgsql
Copier
Modifier
Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...' is invalid.
ðŸ’¡ Cause:
The WebSocket URL is using undefined for the port, which makes the URL invalid.

âœ… Fix:
Check the function where the WebSocket URL is created, probably something like this:

js
Copier
Modifier
const port = process.env.WEBSOCKET_PORT;
const socket = new WebSocket(`wss://localhost:${port}/?token=${token}`);
You're likely missing or incorrectly passing the port value.

If youâ€™re using Vite, Webpack, or Create React App, ensure the env variable is correctly prefixed:

VITE_WEBSOCKET_PORT for Vite

REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_PORT for CRA

Double-check how port is being set or passed into setupWebSocket.

ðŸŸ  2. 401 Unauthorized on Like Request
bash
Copier
Modifier
POST /api/products/<id>/like 401 (Unauthorized)
ðŸ’¡ Cause:
Your request to like a product is unauthorized â€” probably missing or invalid auth headers.

âœ… Fix:
Check your apiClient or wherever the fetch or Axios call happens:

Make sure the Authorization header is present:

ts
Copier
Modifier
headers: {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  ...
}
Make sure the token is not expired or malformed.

Check that the like endpoint requires authentication and whether you're logged in at the time of clicking the "like" button.

You can log the token at the point of the request to verify:

ts
Copier
Modifier
console.log('Token used in like request:', token);
ðŸŸ¢ Normal Logs:
ts
Copier
Modifier
Using token for request: /products/promoted Token length: 192
These are fine and helpful for debugging â€” they show that tokens are generally being used.

Summary of Fixes:
Issue	Fix
WebSocket URL is undefined	Ensure correct port is passed and loaded from .env
401 Unauthorized on /like	Ensure user is logged in and token is valid & present in headers
All other requests seem normal	No issue unless any of them return 4xx or 5xx responses
